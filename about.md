![George MacRorie](/assets/me.jpg)

My name is George MacRorie. I am a developer based in Brighton and I write Go for a living.

I am currently transitioning from [incisive.ly](http://incisive.ly) to working with [Ind.ie](http://ind.ie) on Pulse.

I am currently organising Brighton's first Go meetup [GoBUG](http://gobug.me) as well. I am sorry that I am taking a while, bare with me!
